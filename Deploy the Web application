                                   Deploy the web application
 
 

Step 1: Plan the Application Architecture
Define the core components:
1.	Frontend: React or Angular for the user interface.
2.	Backend: Node.js or Python Flask/Django for APIs.
3.	Database: Amazon RDS for structured data (e.g., user profiles) and DynamoDB for unstructured data (e.g., posts, comments).
4.	Storage: Amazon S3 for storing user-uploaded media like images.
5.	Authentication: AWS Cognito for user sign-in/sign-up.
6.	API Gateway: AWS API Gateway to expose backend APIs securely.
7.	Compute: AWS Lambda or EC2 instances for backend logic.
8.	CI/CD: AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild for automation.
9.	Monitoring: CloudWatch for logs and metrics.
10.	Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to manage resources.
________________________________________
Step 2: Setup the Development Environment
1.	Install development tools:
o	AWS CLI
o	Terraform or AWS CloudFormation
o	Code editors like VS Code
2.	Configure an AWS account with appropriate IAM roles.
________________________________________
Step 3: Develop the Application
3.1 Frontend
•	Build the UI using React or Angular.
•	Store the frontend code in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
3.2 Backend
•	Write APIs in Node.js or Python.
•	APIs include:
o	User management
o	Post creation and retrieval
o	Comments and likes
•	Store backend code in the same or separate repository.
3.3 Database Schema
•	Design the schema for user profiles, posts, and comments.
•	Create tables in Amazon RDS and DynamoDB.
3.4 Storage
•	Configure an S3 bucket for storing media files.
•	Enable public access for read operations (or use signed URLs).
________________________________________
Step 4: Provision AWS Resources
Use Terraform (example snippet):
hcl
Copy code
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "media_bucket" {
  bucket = "fb-clone-media-bucket"
  acl    = "public-read"
}

resource "aws_rds_instance" "db_instance" {
  allocated_storage    = 20
  engine               = "mysql"
  instance_class       = "db.t2.micro"
  name                 = "fb_clone_db"
  username             = "admin"
  password             = "password"
  publicly_accessible  = true
}
________________________________________
Step 5: Setup CI/CD Pipeline
1.	Use AWS CodePipeline:
o	Source: Connect GitHub/CodeCommit for source code.
o	Build: Use CodeBuild to install dependencies and run tests.
o	Deploy: Automate deployments using CodeDeploy.
________________________________________
Step 6: Deploy the Application
1.	Deploy the backend to Lambda or EC2 instances using CodeDeploy.
2.	Deploy the frontend to S3 as a static website or use AWS Amplify.
________________________________________
Step 7: Setup Authentication
1.	Configure AWS Cognito User Pool.
2.	Integrate Cognito with the frontend for user authentication.
________________________________________
Step 8: Test the Application
•	Conduct functional and performance testing.
•	Monitor logs and metrics in CloudWatch.
________________________________________
Step 9: Automate Scaling
•	Use Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.
•	Configure DynamoDB Auto Scaling for throughput.
________________________________________
Step 10: Monitor and Optimize
•	Use CloudWatch alarms to monitor key metrics.
•	Optimize resources for cost efficiency.
